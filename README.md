# Data Pre-processing 
In this research we leveraged the clothing review dataset which was available on Kaggle website.To get rid of noise, inconsistencies, and unnecessary information, thoroughly cleaned the data. Organized text formats, fix typos, and deal with missing values. To create a standardized format, we normalize the text data. Reduce text to lowercase, eliminate punctuation, and use lemmatization or stemming to break words down to their most basic form. Extrapolated pertinent details like sentiment polarity, product attributes, and customer demographics from the text of the customer feedback.
